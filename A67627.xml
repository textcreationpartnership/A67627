            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>OF all the opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the life of man, and indeed of
<pb facs="tcp:34465:10"/>the whole Creation, and of the higheſt and moſt perfect creatures that are found in the whole extent thereof, The moſt Noble and Excellent, the moſt Profitable and truly Delectable, and that which is the Crown and Diadem of their perfection and being, is the operation of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, as that where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by the creature hath Communion with God, which is the moſt
<pb facs="tcp:34465:10"/>excellent being, and the chiefeſt good, and whereby it offereth homage and acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgement unto his Infinite greatneſs, and receives again the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence &amp; enjoyment of his Eternal and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite goodneſſe. And indeed without this the generality of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kinde is not onely de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graded from its digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, but deprived of its uſe; and in the uſeleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, or unprofitable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
<pb facs="tcp:34465:11"/>of mankinde, all the creatures that were made for his comfort and preſervation, are rendered uſeleſſe and unprofitable: So that the end of the whole material Creation is in a ſort loſt, in the want of Religion in mankinde; for if man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kinde be good for no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing without Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, if he looſe that action, then all the creatures would be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come ſerviceable for
<pb facs="tcp:34465:11"/>the preſervation of them that are good for nothing, and ſo being ordered unto a vain end, they would all be as it were vain and unprofitable crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, which would lay an unſufferable charge upon Gods wiſedome as well as goodneſſe, not onely that he made all men in vain, but that he made the creatures of the world for a vain end and purpoſe, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>
               <pb facs="tcp:34465:12"/>(which God forbid.) Now there is no reaſon in the world, why mankind ſhould live, or be in the world, if man be not a worſhipper of God, whereby he is to attain the enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of God.</p>
            <p>Other Creatures indeed have their ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral ends inferior un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to this (yet in order unto this in man) ſome are made for the preſervation of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
<pb facs="tcp:34465:12"/>and all for the good and preſervati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of man. But if man be not the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant of his God here, what is he but <hi>fruges conſumere nat us,</hi> an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>profitable plunderer of the world, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyer of the reſt of the creatures, whom he waſtes and devours in great multitudes daily, whileſt he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf liveth to no con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable end, that may be anſwerable
<pb facs="tcp:34465:13"/>for ſo great a ruine.</p>
            <p>And if his end be in the Grave and in the Duſt, when he hath ſpent a few dayes and hours in eating, and drinking, and ſleep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and enduring many calamities and troubles in this world, it may put all the world to a ſtand, how it could ſtand with the wiſdome of God to make ſuch an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent Creature to no better end; and as the
<pb facs="tcp:34465:13"/>Apoſtle tells us of Chriſtians, <hi>That if in this life only we have hope, we are of all men moſt miſerable.</hi> So it may be ſaid of all mankinde, that if in this life onely, we have our end, we are of all creatures in the world the moſt miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable and unprofita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and the rather, becauſe man hath ſo much knowledge of his infelicity, and ſuch a ſtomach unto eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,
<pb facs="tcp:34465:14"/>which he cannot upon that ſuppoſition upon any terms ever attain unto.</p>
            <p>Which is (to me I confeſſe) one of the ſtrongeſt arguments to prove the immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality of the ſoul of man, and the aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of another and better life after this; that I know how to draw out of the qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver of humane rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, without the clea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer light of Divine Revelation.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:34465:14"/>
            <p>For though it may be ſaid that particular men are made, and are of uſe for the good of Community; (which hath, it may be, gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven the occaſion un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to ſome Philoſophers that could ſee no higher to place the end &amp; final operation of man in politique good, or advantage of humane Society,) Yet when all is done, if man hath no other end but this: that
<pb facs="tcp:34465:15"/>Society, Community &amp; Generality of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kinde, for the ſervice whereof every parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular man is ſuppoſed to be made, will prove in the end to be either of no uſe at all, or of none proportionable to ſuch a multitude of ſo many, ſo excellent beings, if that Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality of mankinde be not appointed for ſome end higher than it ſelf, which what o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther can it be imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
<pb facs="tcp:34465:15"/>to be, than the holy worſhip and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyment of his God, which is indeed the great end for which man was made, and for which both all and every of them have their beings, and their lives, and all the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts, and either gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral or particular ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages in this world that they may be unto them engagements, encouragements and helps, to promote
<pb facs="tcp:34465:16"/>them in the worſhip of him, who is the Fountain of them all: That as they live by his Mercy, they may live unto his Glory here, and attain unto the enjoyment of his Glory hereafter.</p>
            <p>By all this that hath been ſaid, we may then ſee, that it is a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry great and intolera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble miſtake that hath poſſeſſed too many in the world, that Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion and the ſervice
<pb facs="tcp:34465:16"/>of God is a kinde of impertinent thing, or at the beſt but ſuch as is to be attended up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on at our leiſure, or when we have nothing elſe to doe; whereas in truth it is the great reaſon why we live, or enjoy any comfort, or bleſſing here in this world; and of ſo great weight and concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, dignity, profit and advantage, that all other things ought to be ordered unto
<pb facs="tcp:34465:17"/>this, and are no other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe allowable, profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table, or advantagious than as they are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducible hereunto.</p>
            <p>And if Religion, and the Worſhip of God be the moſt Glorious, Honorable and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent imployment, and operation of the life of man, then cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly it doth moſt properly belong, and beſt become thoſe that are of the moſt Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable condition a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt
<pb facs="tcp:34465:17"/>mongſt the Children of men, ſince there is nothing more decent or correſponde<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, than that the moſt eminent perſons ſhould be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſed in the moſt e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minent and excellent operations, and ought to be therein patterns and examples unto o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, looking upon e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very degree of ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancement that God hath given them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove others in point of Dignity, as an ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligation
<pb facs="tcp:34465:18"/>laid upon them by God, who hath beſtowed thoſe preheminencies, to be afore others in Devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and Piety, that they may advance him the more, that hath advanced them ſo much; according to that reſolution of <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid,</hi> a man of the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt degree of honour in this world, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with he dedicates him ſelf and his houſe un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to God, <hi>I wil extol thee,
<pb facs="tcp:34465:18"/>O Lord, becauſ thou hast lifted me up, and haſt not made my foes to tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph over me.</hi> Pſ. 30.1.</p>
            <p>It is a great defor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity in the eys of God of Angels, &amp; of good men, for people to be high in outward ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and dignity, and to be low in Spiritual Grace and Piety; and that they, unto whom God in his bounty hath given moſt lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure and convenien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies to ſerve him, by
<pb facs="tcp:34465:19"/>the freedome (that they enjoy in their a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundance) from world<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ly neceſſities &amp; diſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, &amp; upon whom he lath laid the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt obligations to ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour him, by thoſe honours that he hath beſtowed upon them, ſhould take diſcharge from theſe very obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations, and turn their Bonds into Acquitan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces without the pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Debt, whileſt they of all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
<pb facs="tcp:34465:19"/>are too often moſt negligent of his worſhip, and leaſt frequent in the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly aſſemblies of his people, the attendance whereupon is in a ſort their peculiar calling; and that they ſhould look upon Religion, as a buſineſſe below their greatneſs, which is indeed the Crown and Dignity of their life, ſo that it is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come (as I have found it to my ſorrow) one
<pb facs="tcp:34465:20"/>of the greateſt difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of the work of the Miniſtry to work up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a people that are rich and honourable in this world, and to perſwade them to a conſtant attendance upon Religious Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties in the ſervice of God. I have given ſome blows at this Nail, but it would not enter as I could wiſh, but I muſt not leave it, but tell them again and again, that they
<pb facs="tcp:34465:20"/>are the people of all others, whom God doth expect (as to be moſt exemplary in all other vertues) ſo to be moſt daily and fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent in his publick worſhip. The great ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligations that I have received from ſome of them (which I do with thankfullneſſe acknowledge) muſt not be turned by me into a bribe, to make me flatter or ſpare them in this miſcar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage;
<pb facs="tcp:34465:21"/>I muſt rather venture the looſing of their favour and their bounty too, than coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance the ruine and deſtruction of their ſoules. The more li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berall they have been unto me, the more plainly and ſincerely I muſt deal with them in this matter, remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bring that excellent expreſſion of St. <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broſe</hi> unto his great be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefactor, <hi>Theodoſius</hi> the Emperour, in caſe
<pb facs="tcp:34465:21"/>wherein he held him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf engaged, in thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fullneſs unto him as well as duty to God, to deal plainly with him: <hi>Tantum debeo beneficis tuis, ut male de beam pro ſalute tuâetiam offenſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nem animi tui non time<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re; Iow ſo much unto your bounty and benificence. That I am bound there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by to deſpiſe your anger, that I may contribute to the ſalvation of your ſoul.</hi> This is a ſort of thankfulneſs, that few
<pb facs="tcp:34465:22"/>benefactours will ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept of in this world, becauſe they are grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter friends unto their ſins, than to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves. And upon this account, it may be, I have loſt ſome friends and ſome Auditors, but I cannot help it; but muſt yet ſay, that I can never be ſatisfied with the carriage and converſation of ſuch eminent perſons, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till I ſe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Now as Religion is the moſt eminent and excellent operation of humane life, ſo of all the operations of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, thoſe are of the greateſt power and concernment, moſt prevalent with God, and moſt profitable to man, which are offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed unto God in the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly conſort &amp; heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

            <p>And now by this you may know the reaſon why I have been ſo earneſt with you of my Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, not to neglect the bleſſed opportunities that God offers you for your addreſſes un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him in the uſe of this holy miſtery, and to prepare your ſelves thereunto, and why I have offered you this
<pb facs="tcp:34465:33"/>help, which is preſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted unto you in this enſuing Treatiſe.</p>
            <p>The truth is, that I finde my ſelf under very great obligations unto you, I have recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved much of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort of my life from you, and the great tenderneſs, love, and care that you have ſhew'd unto me in my late ſickneſs (the reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very from which Low under God) in a great meaſure unto ſome of
<pb facs="tcp:34465:33"/>you, addeth unto the endearments that are upon my ſoul toward you, and it lies upon me to do my endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to anſwer your love, which God in his mercy inable me, and direct me to do in ſuch a way as may be moſt for your good and ſpirituall advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage, and truly I think I am in the way, for I cannot pitch upon any thing that can be done more ſumma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily
<pb facs="tcp:34465:34"/>or effectually in order to all your good and happineſſe, than to aſſiſt you in that great and excellent performance of the uſe of the Lords Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, for ſince it is a du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of ſo great perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and ſo comprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive of the whole buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of a Chriſtian, and ſo entitling us to the whole treaſure &amp; comfort of the Goſpel, if I ſhall prevaile with you to be good Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municants,
<pb facs="tcp:34465:34"/>I am ſure I ſhal have then prevai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led with you to be good Chriſtians, and then you muſt needs be both a holy and a happy people.</p>
            <p>Now there are three things that I finde ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to be done, that you may become good Communicants, and uſe that holy and excellent Ordinance to Gods honour and your own comfort and ſalvation.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:34465:35"/>
            <p>The firſt is to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince you of the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity that lies upon you to make a fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent and a diligent uſe of that great means and pledge of your ſalvation, and to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade you that it is your duty to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant therein, and that you cannot neglect a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny oportunity where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by you are called thereunto in the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation of which you are members, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe
<pb facs="tcp:34465:35"/>you have ſome weighty and innocent cauſe to the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, without violating both the authority of Chriſts command, and the love of his invita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in the inſtitution of the Lords Supper, and if you do but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider theſe obligati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons that Chriſt our Lord hath laid upon us, and the great and excellent duties that we there are called to offer unto God, and
<pb facs="tcp:34465:36"/>the great &amp; manifold graces &amp; mercies that God therein offers un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to us; and remember what I have often ſaid unto you, touching this matter, I cannot ſee how you will be excuſable, if you ſhall wilfully without ſome very weighty &amp; war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantable impediment abſtain from the uſe of this holy Ordinance of God; aſſure your ſelves, neither pride, nor ſloath, nor love
<pb facs="tcp:34465:36"/>unto any ſin, nor wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full ignorance, when the means of inſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is offered and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſed; no, nor ſervile fear, nor the love of this world will be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted for diſcharges of our attendance up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on God in this Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian duty, for all thoſe are ſinfull, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore are not like to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe us from duty.</p>
            <p>The Second is, that you be directed and perſwaded to a due
<pb facs="tcp:34465:37"/>preparation of your ſelves unto this holy Sacrament, that we may not eat that bread and drink that cup of the Lord unworthily, leaſt we bring thereby both great guilt and judgement upon our ſoules, and make even that Table to be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuare unto us, whileſt we approach with im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penitent, unbelieving uncharitable, untha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>k<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, cold and earthly minds, not diſcerning
<pb facs="tcp:34465:37"/>the body of Chriſt.</p>
            <p>The Third is, that we be rightly adviſed and aſſiſted, for the due diſpoſition of our hearts, &amp; imploy ment of our thoughts and affections, in &amp; about the time of the recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the holy Supper of the Lord.</p>
            <p>You will I hope, finde ſomthing in this little Manuall, that may be ſerviceable to you for all theſe pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes, as in the little
<pb facs="tcp:34465:38"/>Catechiſm, and ſome devotions, that are ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded unto the former edition thereof, and I do earneſtly deſire all of you from the eldeſt to the youngeſt, that are capable, to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaint themſelves with that little Cate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiſme, ſo as to be able to give an account thereof, and if they would exerciſe their humility ſo farr, as to give me leave to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive it from them, it
<pb facs="tcp:34465:38"/>would be a comfort to me, &amp; I hope no hurt or diſhonour unto them; remember that of our bleſſed Saviour, <hi>Except ye become as lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle children, ye cannot enter into the Kingdom of God,</hi> Mat. 18.3. And that of St. <hi>Peter, Be rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to give an anſwer unto every man that asketh you a reaſon of the hope that is in you, with meekneſs and fear.</hi> 1 Pet. 3.15.</p>
            <p>But the firſt and pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar
<pb facs="tcp:34465:39"/>buſineſs of this Book, was to be help<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full unto you and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, for their more eaſy and orderly deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very of holy thoughts, about the time of the receiving of the Lords ſupper, and after the uſe thereof.</p>
            <p>The work that is done in that holy So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnity is of that na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, that though it aimes at the greateſt unity and fellowſhip that can be in an holy
<pb facs="tcp:34465:39"/>Congregation, which are all thereby gather<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed up cloſe together into Chriſt; yet it of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers particular and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tired employment to thoughts and affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of every particular receiver: Unto whom (being rightly quali. fied and prepared) it offers &amp; ſeals all that mercy &amp; grace which the Goſpel promiſeth in general unto all that are penitent Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners &amp; true Believers;
<pb facs="tcp:34465:40"/>and requires of every one a very ſerious at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendance unto private and ſecret meditation and holy devotion. There are in the time of that ſacred Celebra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion many pauſes and intermiſſions of the joynt imployment of the Congregation, which doth, as it were, ſeparate them unto their ſeveral works in their Soules. Whileſt ſome are Receiving, it is the buſineſſe of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
<pb facs="tcp:34465:40"/>to be in the holy preparation of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to the Duty; And they that have thus paſſed through both theſe performan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, are to be exerciſed in the admiration of that mercy they have received, &amp; in the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flaming of their hearts unto the holy praiſes of the Lord. Some courſe hath been taken heretofore in ſome Congregations to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent the chaſme that
<pb facs="tcp:34465:41"/>might be in the ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual work, &amp; the fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of thoughts for want of holy ſuggeſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, by the ſinging of a Pſalm at the very time of the celebrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: But beſides that the pattern of our Saviours practiſe, <hi>Mat.</hi> 26.30. leads us to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve that to be a work more proper and fit to ſucceed than accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany that holy Buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs: The very noiſe of that ſervice, in thoſe
<pb facs="tcp:34465:41"/>that are at leaſure to be employed in it, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears to be too great an Enemy unto that ſevere attention and holy ſequeſtration of ſpirit that is required in thoſe that are to be employed in Recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving, which doth leaſt of all admit of the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers of diſtraction. I know no way better to prevent all incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniencies, &amp; to make up all gaps in that ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred celebration, than
<pb facs="tcp:34465:42"/>to offer ſome variety of ſhort Meditations &amp; Devotions, into the hands, and unto the hearts of the parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Receivers, to be uſed according to thoſe ſeverall works that they have to doe, which may be as ſo many ſeveral notes of the Spiritual Song; which being compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed in their right or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der and conſent, will make up an holy Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony in the ears of
<pb facs="tcp:34465:42"/>the Almighty. If any part ſeem too long, there is nothing impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, but every Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municant may ſatisfie the bents of their own devotions, &amp; anſwer the meaſure of their time and leaſure, by marking out ſome of the ſhorteſt forms un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to themſelves, eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally in that which is to be done about the time of the receiving; Or, if they have better of their own, or from
<pb facs="tcp:34465:43"/>any other, they may ſpare their troubling of themſelves with this.</p>
            <p>God (I hope) will pardon the infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and his people ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept of the poore en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours of him</p>
